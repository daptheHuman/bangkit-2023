Question 1
You can verify that software code behaves correctly using test ___.

1 / 1 point

Loops


Functions


Cases


Arguments

Correct
Awesome! The software code should behave the way you expect with as many possible values or test cases.

Question 2
What is the most basic way of testing a script?

1 / 1 point

Different parameters with expected results.


Codifying tests into the software.


Let a bug slip through. 


Write code to do the tests.

Correct
Right on! The most basic way of testing a script is to use different parameters and get the expected results.

Question 3
When a test is codified into its own software, what kind of test is it?

1 / 1 point

Unit test


Integration test


 Automatic test


Sanity testing

Correct
Nice job!  Codifying tests into its own software and code that can be run to verify that our programs do what we expect them to do is automatic testing.

4.
Question 4
Using _____ simplifies the testing process, allowing us to verify the program's behavior repeatedly with many possible values.

1 / 1 point

integration tests


test cases


test-driven development


interpreter

Correct
Great work! Test cases automatically test with a range of possible values to verify the programâ€™s behavior.

5.
Question 5
The more complex our code becomes, the more value the use of _____ provides in managing errors.

1 / 1 point

loops


functions


parameters


software testing

Correct
Awesome! Software testing is the process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what you expect it to do, and the more complex the code, the more likely failure is.
