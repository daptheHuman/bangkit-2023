Question 1
When your IDE automatically creates an indent for you, this is known as what?

1 / 1 point

Code completion


Interpreted language


Syntax highlighting


Code reuse

Correct
Nicely done! Code completion is an IDE feature that takes educated guesses about what you might be trying to type next, and offers suggestions to complete it for you.

Question 2
Can you identify the error in the following code?

9
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import numpy as np

def numpyArray():
    x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)
    y = numpy.array([[3, 6, 2], [9, 12, 8]], np.int32)
    return x*y
print(numpyArray())


1 / 1 point

The function is not indented properly.


The shebang line is not necessary.


The y variable is not calling the numpy module properly.


numpy is not imported correctly because as is used.

Correct
Nice job! While the x variable is calling numpy using its declared local name, y is not using the local name. This will result in an error.

Question 3
Which type of programming language is read and converted to machine code before runtime, allowing for more efficient code?

1 / 1 point

Object-oriented language


Compiled language


Interpreted language


Intermediate code

Correct
Awesome! A compiled language is translated into code readable by the target machine during development using a compiler.

Question 4
Which of the following is not an IDE or code editor?

1 / 1 point

Eclipse


pip


Atom


PyCharm

Correct
Right on! The package manager pip is used in Python to install packages from repositories such as PyPI.

5.
Question 5
What does the PATH variable do?

1 / 1 point

Tells the operating system where to find executables


Returns the current working directory


Holds the command line arguments of your Python program in a list


Tells the operating system where to cache frequently used files

Correct
Nice work! The PATH variable tells the operating system where to find executables.
