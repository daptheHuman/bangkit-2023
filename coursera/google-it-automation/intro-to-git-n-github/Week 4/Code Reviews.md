Question 1
When should we respond to comments from collaborators and reviewers?

1 / 1 point

When their comments address software-breaking bugs


No need, just resolve the concerns and be done with it


Always


Only when a code correction is necessary

Correct
Excellent! It is good manners and proper conduct to respond, even when it's simply an acknowledgement.

Question 2
What is a nit?

1 / 1 point

A trivial comment or suggestion


A couple lines of code


A repository that is no longer maintained


An orphaned branch

Correct
Good work! In git jargon (and elsewhere in the tech world), a nit is a minor “nitpick” about a piece of code.

Question 3
Select common code issues that might be addressed in a code review. (Check all that apply)

1 / 1 point

Using unclear names

Correct
Excellent! Unclear names can make our code hard to understand.


Following PEP8 guidelines


Forgetting to handle a specific condition

Correct
Alright! If there is a specific condition that could cause a problem and we don't address it, the result could be catastrophic.


Forgetting to add tests

Correct
Woohoo! Tests are an important addition to our code to ensure it runs smoothly.

Question 4
If we've pushed a new version since we've made a recent change, what might our comment be flagged as?

1 / 1 point

Accepted


Resolved


Outdated


Merged

Correct
Nice job! If we push a new version after making a change, old comments are marked with the "Outdated" flag.

Question 5
What are the goals of code review? (Check all that apply)

1 / 1 point

Make sure that the contents are easy to understand

Correct
Right on! By reviewing our code, we can identify where we can make our code more clear and easy to understand.


Ensure consistent style

Correct
Awesome! By comparing our code to style guidelines, we can keep our style consistent and readable.


Build perfect code


Ensure we don't forget any important cases

Correct
Good job. Code review can reveal cases or conditions we need to handle in our code.
