Question 1
How do we reference issues in our commits with automatic links?

1 / 1 point

By using one of the keywords followed by a hashtag and the issue number.


By using an asterisk (*) after the issue number.


By typing the issue number inside braces ({}).


By using a special keyword.

Correct
Right on! Keywords such as closes or resolves followed by a hashtag and the issue number will tell Git to autolink to the issue with the provided ID number.

Any file generated as part of the CI/CD pipeline.


An unintended minor glitch in a computer program


An automated series of tests that run each time there is a new commit or pull request.

Question 3
Which of the following statements are good advice for project maintainers? (Check all that apply)

1 / 1 point

Coordinate solely via email


Reply promptly to pull-requests

Correct
Woohoo!  The more time that passes until a pull-request gets reviewed, the more likely it is that there's a new commit that causes a conflict when you try to merge in the change.


Understand any changes you accept

Correct
Nice job! Not only do we not know whether the original coder is going to be around to maintain those functions, we also want to avoid feature creep and unmanageable code.


Use an issue tracker 

Correct
Excellent! The larger our project grows, the more useful an issue tracker can be for collaborating.

Not quite. When it comes to coordinating who does what and when, a common strategy for active software projects is to use an issue tracker.
